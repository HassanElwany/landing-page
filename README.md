# Landing Page Project

# I make the landing page again 
i influenced by many tutorials this time I tried to do my best
# JS
in JS firstly I declared to variables to hand the ul list and the sections 
then I made a faction which's looping throw sections to append every section by li element.
then another function to determine the current viewport section and check if it has an active class or not if it hasn't the function adds it to the section while it is on the current viewport.

# Css 
a littel bit changes for a responsivity 
make the scrolling smoothy
